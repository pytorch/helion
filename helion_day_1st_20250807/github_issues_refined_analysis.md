### 5. **Execution Modes & Debugging (3 issues)**
Clear category - Issues specific to interpreter/debug modes
- **#447**: HELION_INTERPRET=1 silently hides HELION_PRINT_OUTPUT_CODE=1
- **#464**: Numerical error with HELION_INTERPRET=1
- **#466**: HELION_INTERPRET=1 only prints once for fixed block_size

### 6. **Advanced/Meta Features (1 issue)**
Clear category - Advanced metaprogramming features
- **#491**: helion_vmap metaprogramming crashes

## Refined Key Insights

### Category 2 (Type System & Shape) Breakdown:
- **Dynamic shapes** are a major pain point, with multiple issues around reshape operations and shape specialization
- **Type inference** has bugs with type promotion and handling of symbolic integers
- Both subcategories represent fundamental compiler infrastructure issues

### Category 4 (Operator Support) Breakdown:
- **Operator coverage** gaps (lerp not working)
- **API requirements** not well enforced (kernel without tile)
- **Resource limits** not properly checked before execution

## Priority Areas Based on Refined Analysis

1. **High Priority**: Dynamic shape handling (2a) - multiple users hitting reshape/specialization issues
2. **High Priority**: Type inference bugs (2b) - affects correctness and usability
3. **Medium Priority**: Operator coverage (4a) - individual operators can be added incrementally
4. **Medium Priority**: Resource management (4c) - needs better pre-flight checks
5. **Low Priority**: API requirements (4b) - one-time user education issue
